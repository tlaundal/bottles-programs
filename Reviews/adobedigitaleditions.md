Review for Adobe Digital Editions.

Maintainer: @tlaundal

**Is the program properly opened?**  
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**  
Grade: Gold  
Additional notes: When using the caffe runner, the installer crashes at the very end (when opening a promotional message for another program). This does not affect the installation, and is not a problem with the soda runner.

**Does it show graphical glitches?**  
Grade: Silver
Additional notes: When opening a book, the window sometimes turns black, and needs to be moved around on the screen to show the UI. This is a problem in the caffe runner, but not with soda.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a
